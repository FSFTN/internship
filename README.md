FSFTN is offering summer internships for college students. The internship will be a remote intership (which means that you can work from your choice of location) and the duration of the intership is flexible ranging between 3-5 weeks. 

The following are the pre-requisites for those applying for internships.

Those applying should be familiar with:

  a)One of the Gnu/Linux Operating System ( We are not including ubuntu/mint here right ? They are not really free OS's. )

  b) Basic shell commands and shell script

  c) git(version control system)

  d) Create simple web application(CRUD) using HTML,CSS and JavaScript(use framework if you know)
